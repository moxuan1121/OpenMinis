// bar that says what it is: "Agent · <task>", tier badge, elapsed while
// running, and a Stop button. It is reached from the agent's tool sheet
// ("Open live agent conversation"), from the insurance notification tap and
// from the debug RPC; the tool sheet itself is the same ToolLiveSheet every
// other tool gets.

///   makes a swipe inside the message list scroll the list, instead of the
///   default where a swipe at the list's top edge resizes the sheet. Resizing
///   is done from the grabber / nav bar. On iOS 16.0–16.3 the modifier does
